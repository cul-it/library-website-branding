# library-website-branding

This repository contains Cornell University Library branding files for use on electronic resources.

**cornell-resources.pdf** contains mockups of branding options A (banner) and B (logo only).

## Option A

The **option A - banner** folder contains simple HTML markup for adding a red Cornell bar to an electronic resource. Note that vendors may choose to write the HTML and CSS for their resources themselves, in which case they can refer to cornell-eresources.pdf for how the banner should look on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Option B

The **option B - logo** folder contains a Cornell University Library logo for resources that cannot implement Option A (banner).

The *final* folder contains graphics that have been resized for use. These may be linked to directly from electronic resources.

The *source* folder contains source files which can be resized as needed.

Please contact libraryux@cornell.edu with any questions.
